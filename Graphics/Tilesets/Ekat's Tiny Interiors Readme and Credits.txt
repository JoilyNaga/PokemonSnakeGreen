All the tilesets here are part of an art challenge I gave myself to see how many tilesets I could make in an afternoon. 
The sets are small. But, my intention when making them was that devs would add their own objects/pre-existing ones to the set.  

There are six tilesets included in this package. They are free for use for non-commercial projects. 
They have been specifically designed for RPG Maker, making them perfect for anyone using a gen 3 style with their project in Pok√©mon Essentials.
